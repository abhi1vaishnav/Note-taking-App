# Note-taking-App
A quick and convenient way to write down notes in your head! Simply enter in the note, and it will be organized with all other notes while automatically save to local storage.

Javascript made it easy to delete notes, set key functions and save notes. A script file contains various functions that provide the app's functionality.

HTML and CSS were used to create the note-taking elements and style the app. A Linear gradient background, icons and consistent theme compose of the UI/UX.
